        <h2>Version: 1.0 beta</h2>
        <p><b>jide.js</b> is currently in beta state. This means that it is neither feature complete nor without bugs and
        that its APIs can change when necessary.</p>
        <h2>Free and OpenSource</h2>
        <p><b>jide.js</b> has been released under terms of the OpenSource MIT license. It can be used in personal
            and commercial projects for free. You can even <a href="http://github.com/jidesoft/jidejs">Fork it on Github</a>.</p>
        <h2>Cross Browser Support</h2>
        <p><b>jide.js</b> works across all modern browsers.  It has been designed to be the future of web development and makes a
clean break with older browsers such as IE8 and earlier to enable you to develop for the web as it is now and not as it
was years ago.</p>
