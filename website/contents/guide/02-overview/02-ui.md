# jidejs/ui Introduction

The jidejs/ui package contains many of the most commonly used visual components required by web applications. It has
been created on top of the jidejs/base package and the concept of observable properties and lists.

When using the jidejs/ui package, you can choose between different types of components:
{@link module:jidejs/ui/layout/Pane panes} and {@link module:jidejs/ui/Control controls}. Panes are used for arranging
other components in a certain layout while controls are directly used by the user of the application. Prominent examples
for controls are {@link module:jidejs/ui/control/Button} and {@link module:jidejs/ui/control/Label}.

## Initializing controls

If you have already taken a look at the API documentation of some of the classes in the `jidejs/ui/control` package,
you may have noticed that most of their constructors expects a `config` object to be passed in.

These `config` objects are copied to the created control using {@link module:jidejs/ui/Component.applyConfiguration}.
Thus, by providing a suitable `config` object, you can set any property of the control or the controls it extends.
You can also specify children, if there are any, event handlers, CSS styles and classes.

```javascript
require(['jidejs/ui/control/Button'], function(Button) {
    var myButton = new Button({
        // the configuration for the button goes here
        text: "Click me", // "text" is a property of Labeled, that is an ancestor type of Button
        classList: ['my-really-cool-button'], // add a custom CSS class
        on: {
            // specify event handlers here
            'action': function() {
                // handle the 'action' event here
            }
        }
    });
});
```

## Adding components to the DOM

At the moment, jide.js doesn't offer an automatic way to insert your component structure into the DOM. Thus, you have two
options, that both work equally well.

**Add {@link module:jidejs/ui/Component~element} to the DOM**

```javascript
// given the 'myButton' object created above
document.getElementById('myButton_container').appendChild(myButton.element);
```

**Use an existing element as the components element**
Your HTML needs to contain a `div` element with the ID `myButton`.

```javascript
require(['jidejs/ui/control/Button'], function(Button) {
    var myButton = new Button({
        element: document.getElementById('myButton'),
        // ... same as before
    });
});
```

Note that at this time it is often necessary that the element is empty when it is used for a component.

## Creating a simple application

In this part of the tutorial, we will explore the creation of a simple contact management application. It will
allow its user to create, read, update and delete contacts and will teach you the basics of setting up the UI structure
and the simplicity of creating advanced data bindings.

Start with the simple HTML file:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Contacts application demo</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../../../controls/style/default.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>A simple contact management application</h1>
    <div id="approot"></div>
    <script src="../../lib/require.js" data-main="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

And continue with an appropriate Javascript file, in this case we call it *main.js* and locate it directly next to
the HTML file.

**Important:** If you've placed your **jide.js** download in some path you need to configure _require.js_ (or whatever AMD loader you're
using) so that it can find the **jide.js** files.

Then start your application code by importing all used modules:

```javascript
require([
	'jidejs/base/Class',
	'jidejs/base/ObservableProperty',
	'jidejs/base/ObservableList',
	'jidejs/ui/layout/GridPane',
	'jidejs/ui/control/ListView',
	'jidejs/ui/control/TextField',
	'jidejs/ui/control/Button'
], function(
	Class, ObservableProperty, ObservableList,
	GridPane,
	ListView, TextField, Button
) {
```

Our contact model will only need two properties: first name and phonenumber, so just define a simple constructor
that sets up the appropriate, observable, properties. Using {@link module:jidejs/base/ObservableProperty} allows us to
bind its data to UI controls and back:

```javascript
function Contact(firstName, phoneNumber) {
    // define and initialize the contact properties
    installer(this);
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
}
var installer = ObservableProperty.install(Contact, 'firstName', 'phoneNumber');
```

In practice, you'd now import the data from some other source, i.e. using XHR or similar, however, for the purpose of
this demo, we'll define the data inline, using an {@link module:jidejs/base/ObservableList} which will allow us to add
and remove data even easier:

```javascript
var contacts = ObservableList([
    new Contact('Sarah', randomPhoneNumber()),
    new Contact('Jane', randomPhoneNumber()),
    new Contact('Joe', randomPhoneNumber()),
    new Contact('Paul', randomPhoneNumber()),
    new Contact('George', randomPhoneNumber()),
    new Contact('Sam', randomPhoneNumber()),
    new Contact('Dean', randomPhoneNumber())
]);
```

Next we define the UI for our application. We will store some of the controls in variables so that we can use them
for our data bindings later on:

```javascript
var contactList, nameField, phoneNumberField;
var root = new GridPane({
    // create a GridPane and use the #approot element as its base
    element: document.getElementById('approot'),
    // define the grid, 3x3
    grid: [
        // 'list' spans five rows, name and phone span two columns
        'list new   delete',
        'list .     .',
        'list name  name',
        'list phone phone',
        'list .     call'
    ],
    // define rows, use automatic sizing (each will be as high as needed) but set the second row to be 25px high, it is
    // used to visually separate the new/delete buttons from the textfields
    rowDefinition: 'auto 25px auto auto auto',
    // define columns, set fixed width for the list, use automatic sizing for the others (each will be as wide as needed)
    columnDefinition: '200px auto auto',
    // now add the children
    children: [
        // add contact list
        contactList = new ListView({
            // specify area
            'GridPane.area': 'list',
            // make it take the full width within its parent
            width: '100%',
            // set the contacts list as its items
            items: contacts,
            // use the first name of the contact as its representation in the list
            converter: function(contact) {
                return contact.firstNameProperty;
            }
        }),
        // add name field
        nameField = new TextField({
            'GridPane.area': 'name'
        }),
        // add phone number field
        phoneNumberField = new TextField({
            'GridPane.area': 'phone'
        }),
        // add the call button
        new Button({
            'GridPane.area': 'call',
            text: 'Call',
            on: {
                // react to its click
                action: function() {
                    // get the currently selected contact
                    var contact = contactList.selectionModel.selectedItem;
                    if(contact) {
                        alert('Calling '+contact.firstName+' at '+contact.phoneNumber);
                    } else {
                        alert('No contact selected!');
                    }
                }
            }
        }),
        new Button({
            'GridPane.area': 'new',
            text: 'New',
            on: {
                action: function() {
                    // create a new contact
                    var newContact = new Contact('New Contact', '');
                    // add it to the original contacts list, updates the ListView automatically
                    contacts.add(newContact);
                    // select the new contact
                    contactList.selectionModel.clearAndSelect(newContact);
                }
            }
        }),
        new Button({
            'GridPane.area': 'delete',
            text: 'Delete',
            on: {
                'action': function() {
                    // delete the currently selected item from the list, updates the ListView automatically
                    contacts.remove(contactList.selectionModel.selectedItem);
                }
            }
        })
    ]
});
```

The {@link module:jidejs/ui/layout/GridPane} is the most complex but also most powerful layout pane in *jide.js*. By
mastering this layout pane, there is almost no layout you cannot create. By using its *grid* template, we
significantly simplify its usage as is shown in the above code sample.

At this stage, the demo will display several {@link module:jidejs/ui/control/TextField textfields} and
{@link module:jidejs/ui/control/Button buttons}. The buttons will already work, allowing the user of the application
to create and delete contacts as well as "calling" them. The textfields, however, are without function.

For this demo we will want to use one the most complex use cases of textfields. Whenever the user selects an item from the
list, we want the textfields to display that contacts information. When the user changes the text within the textfields,
we want the list cell to update and change the data within the contact object.

In traditional UI frameworks, we'd have to add event listeners to the ListView and both textfields and update the data of
each when the user interacts with it. Thankfully, **jide.js** doesn't require such boilerplate and allows us to achieve the
expected behaviour with just two data bindings:

```javascript
var selectedItemProperty = contactList.selectionModel.selectedItemProperty;
nameField.textProperty.bindBidirectional(selectedItemProperty.select('firstNameProperty'));
phoneNumberField.textProperty.bindBidirectional(selectedItemProperty.select('phoneNumberProperty'));
```

Since the `selectedItemProperty` of the {@link module:jidejs/ui/control/SelectionModel} is a property, we can easily
store it in a variable for shorter access. The `select` method creates a writable
{@link module:jidejs/base/DependencyProperty} that depends on both, the `selectedItemProperty` and the `firstNameProperty`
(or the `phoneNumberProperty` respectivly). It will contain the firstName (or phoneNumber) of the selected contact.

And that was all that is required for our simple demo application (minus a function that creates a fake phonenumber and
closing the _require_ call).

You can take a look at the full demo [here](../demo/apps/contacts/index.html).
