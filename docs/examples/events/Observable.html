<section data-role="about">
    <p>When using an {@link jidejs/base/Observable}, remember that you can access its value using the
        {@link jidejs/base/Observable~get} method and that you can change its value using the
    {@link jidejs/base/Observable~set} method.</p>
    <p>A <code>computed</code> observable will only recalculate its value when one of the observables it depends on has
    changed. It will also calculate its value lazily, which means that its value will not be calculated before it is actually
    accessed.</p>
    <p>Observables are a great way to encapsulate the state of an application if it fits into a single object.</p>
    <p>In fact, the application that powers this website is built around two observables: The requested example id and
    the actual example object which contains all necessary data to generate the UI of the application.</p>
    <p>To learn how to get informed when the value of an observable changes, please take a look at the
        <a href="#!/events/Subscription.html">Subscription</a> example.</p>
