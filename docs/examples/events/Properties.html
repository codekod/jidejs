    <p>This demo shows how to use {@link jidejs/base/ObservableProperty} in the <em>ViewModel</em> or <em>Model</em> layer
        of your application.</p>

require(['jidejs/base/ObservableProperty'], function(ObservableProperty) {
    // Note: You could use any class framework you like, in fact, jide.js provides the jidejs/base/Class module
    // that can be used to define Javascript classes with a slightly nicer syntax but jide.js does not require to use
    // any specific class framework.

    // using ObservableProperty.install saves us from having to include a lot of repetitive code
    // like creating a new ObservableProperty and adding accessors and mutators for each of them.
    // Of course you could also directly access them using the `get` and `set` methods but using fields is
    // easier to read and write.
    var installProperties = ObservableProperty.install(Person, 'firstName', 'lastName');
    // define our Person class
    function Person(firstName, lastName) {
        // use the installer created by ObservableProperty.install to initialize `firstNameProperty`
        // and `lastNameProperty` fields on our new Person object
        installProperties(this);
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    // Create a new person
    var john = new Person('John', 'Doe');

    // now we've got choices on how to listen to changes.
    // Using ObservableProperty requires your data object to be an EventEmitter. The `install` method takes
    // care of mixin in the EventEmitter automatically, thus we can simply listen to the appropriate events:
    john.on('change:firstName', function(event) {
        log(event.oldValue+"'s <b>first name</b> was changed to "+event.value);
    });

    // or we can subscribe to the ObservableProperty itself
    john.lastNameProperty.subscribe(function(event) {
        log(john.firstName+" "+event.oldValue+" has a new last name: "+event.value);
    });

    // and now change the first and last name of John
    john.firstName = 'Max'; // using field mutator
    john.lastNameProperty.set('Mustermann'); // or using the property

    // this utility function appends an entry to our visible log
    function log(msg) {
        root.querySelector('#xlog').appendChild(function() {
            var li = document.createElement('li');
            li.innerHTML = msg;
            return li;
        }());
    }

<section data-role="about">
    <p>A central part of every application is the concept of notifying the View when the Model (or ViewModel) has been changed.</p>
    <p>Since not every application can contain its data in a simple, {@link jidejs/base/Observable} object, jide.js
    also provides the concept of {@link jidejs/base/ObservableProperty} &mdash; a property of an object that is
    observable.</p>
    <p>As opposed to {@link jidejs/base/Observable}, the {@link jidejs/base/ObservableProperty} does not mixin an
    {@link jidejs/base/EventEmitter}. Instead, the object it belongs to is expected to mixin {@link jidejs/base/EventEmitter}.</p>
    <p>Throughout <em>jide.js</em>, most of the properties provided by our controls use {@link jidejs/base/ObservableProperty}
    to store the information the view needs, such as the text displayed by a button or the content of a popup.</p>
    <p>It is common practice to add a suffic of <i>Property</i> to the fields containing the actual
        {@link jidejs/base/ObservableProperty} and to provide a field that updates the property when its mutated (using
    getters and setters as specified in the EcmaScript 5 specification, i.e. by using <code>Object.defineProperty</code>).
    Since all that requires a certain amount of boilerplate, it is advisable to use the
        {@link jidejs/base/ObservableProperty.install} method instead. This also makes your application future-proof for
    the time when browsers support the new <code>Object.observe</code> method.</p>
